        <h2>About the GOAT</h2>
        <p>
            William Sanford Nye is an American science communicator, 
            comedian, author, and inventor. He's best known for 
            hosting the Emmy award-winning educational show Bill 
            Nye the Science Guy, which aired from 1993-1998. Nye's
            passion for science education continues through his 
            work as CEO of The Planetary Society, a nonprofit that
            promotes space exploration and environmental stewardship

        <h2>Why he's the GOAT</h2>
        <p>
            Watching his videos in science classes in school is what initally got me intrested in science.
            If I had never seen any of his vidoes, I wouldn't have the same intrests I do now. 
            He's also just really cool.
